## Install + Setup
- clone this repo: (https://github.com/tstaros23/Tower-Defense)
- **Install** Java: Ensure Java is installed on your computer. You can check by opening a terminal or command prompt and running **'java -version'**. If Java is not installed, proceed to the next step.
- **Download Java**: Visit the OpenJDK website [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and download the appropriate version of Java for your operating system.
- **Run the installer**: Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
- **Verify the installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run **'java -version'** again. You should see the version information displayed, confirming that Java is installed correctly.

## Rules
- The object of the game is to defend the tower from getting hit by comets and asteroids. 
- To defend the tower, the player must place  sattelites and/or space stateions that fire missles and torpedos at the comets and asteroids
- Click and drag the space station or sattelite from the menu to space.
- Sattelites shoot torpedos and space stations shoot missles
- Sattelites and space stations cannot be placed on the asteroid and comet's path
- Each player starts with 1000 dollars. Each time a asteroid or comet is destroyed, a player earns 10 dollars
- Sattelites cost 100 dollars to use and space stations cost 300 dollars
- When a player runs out of money, they cannot purchase a space station or sattelite until they earn more.
- The player starts out with 50 cities and each time an asteroid or comet collides with earth, a city is destroyed
- Once all 50 cites are destroyed, the game is over.


## Learning Goals
  - Basic Programming in Java: Students will learn the fundamentals of programming using Java as their programming language.
  - Advanced Java Topics: Students will delve into more advanced Java concepts and techniques, including object-oriented programming (inheritance and polymorphism).
  - Abstraction and Problem Solving: Students will understand the importance of abstraction and apply it to design larger software projects. They will also develop problem-solving skills in the context of software development.
  - Algorithms: Students will explore algorithms and their role in software design and development. They will learn how to analyze the complexity of algorithms.
  - GUI Programming: Students will gain knowledge and experience in graphical user interface (GUI) programming, enabling them to create interactive applications with user-friendly interfaces.
  - Software Engineering Practices: Students will be introduced to software engineering practices, including principles of software design, code organization, documentation, and testing.

These learning goals are aimed at preparing students for more advanced studies in computer science by providing them with a solid foundation in Java programming, object-oriented design, problem-solving, and software engineering principles.
